<h1>Technologies Used:</h1>
<p>Node.js, jQuery, MySQL, Sequelize, Passport.js, Materialize</p>

<h3>Passport.js</h3>

<p>This technology handles the apps login and registration.  New users are currently prompted to create a user name
and password, along with entering key information about their property.  The property information is stored in a MySQL database.  Passport then handles the log in process, checking for valid users that have registered.  Future versions will have new users be redirected to log in after registration (they are currently not).  Furthermore, password reminders and resets will be implemented in the future.</p>
